## Our mission

We started Theatre.js because we were inspired by the work of artists and engineers pushing the boundaries of what‚Äôs possible to create on the web.

One example is the beautiful world of [_microsites_](https://www.awwwards.com/websites/sites_of_the_month/), where the aesthetics of the web are constantly being pushed by creative developers and technical artists. These routinely contain [motion graphics](https://grids.obys.agency/), [sharder art](https://www.ibm.com/resources/activations/harmonic-state), [3D](https://www.prometheusfuels.com/), audio, and many more elements not typically found in web content.

We are also inspired by _data storytellers_, who are crafting narratives with [emotional vibrancy](http://www.fallen.io/ww2/) and factual nuance, properties sorely needed in the media environment of today.

We also love the educational potential of _[explorable explanations](https://explorabl.es/)_, a new format for teaching and learning with an incredible bandwidth for knowledge transfer. One great example is [The Parable of the Polygons](https://ncase.me/polygons/), a short _explorable_ that demonstrates what normally takes several chapters of exposition in a book, and compresses it into a few minutes of intuitive play.

We call these new formats ‚Äú_web interactives_‚Äù because they are uniquely enabled by the web. They take advantage the portability and openness of the tech stack, and the social mechanics that is inherent to the web.

Even more inspiring with _web interactives_ is how they are flourishing despite the field being under-tooled. That is, while existing creative tools don‚Äôt accommodate the unique needs of web interactives, these creators make up for that by rolling their own bespoke tools, and when that‚Äôs not enough, they just design in code.

This under-tooling hampers the growth of web interactives, but also highlights the resourcefulness of existing creators and the growth potential of this medium.

Theatre.js is our response to this under-tooling. We are designing it to serve the unique needs of people who make web interactives, namely:

- They require an especially close collaboration between highly talented artists and engineers
- They routinely involve members of other disciplines like scientists, data storytellers, or educators
- Their output requires uncompromising performance, and high graphical fidelity

These exceptionally challenging requirements inform the design of Theatre.js. Instead of building a ‚Äúdesign tool‚Äù or a ‚Äúdev tool,‚Äù we intend for Theatre.js to enable artists and engineers to collaborate _on the same thing_, fully own their tech stack, and build domain-specific tools on top. Our motion editor is one such example, with more domain-specific tools on the way. We are especially excited by the domain specific tools the rest of the community will come up with.

Lastly, these requirements would be impossible to achieve without open software, which is why we‚Äôre developing Theatre.js open-source with meaningful collaboration from the community.

## A community effort

Perhaps the most encouraging sign that we‚Äôre on the right track is how quickly a community formed around Theatre.js. We made our first release back in September with no existing community, and we limited the launch to a single thread on twitter. The heartwarming reaction by the community, including many industry veterans, made our launch go viral, made the project trend on GitHub with 4K stars, and brought in our first group of users.

Today I'm launching Theatre.js, a hackable animation library with visual tools.

It helps you to:

- Help you craft detailed motion
- Apply the motion to #threejs, HTML, SVG, or any JS value
- Build custom visual tooling for your own libraries and workflow

Some highlights üßµüëá

Today, Theatre.js is being adopted by some of the most creative people and companies in the industry. We have been humbled by all the ways our community used Theatre.js and helped it grow, and inspired by the ways [some of the best in the industry](https://twitter.com/michaeltheory/status/1455882461796347906) turned to Theatre.js to push the boundaries of what's possible on the web.
