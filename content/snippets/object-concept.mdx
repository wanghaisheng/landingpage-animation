Everything on the page or in the scene is represented as an object.
Objects can be THREE.js objects, `<div>`s, or virtual objects that don't exist on the screen.

{/* "Objects" (also referred to as Sheet Objects) are containers for several properties which can be animated. */}
{/* When you create an object using `sheet.object(name, props)`, you'll be adding the object to the animation sequence. */}
{/* Maybe an animation here where the "objects" in the animation are highlighted? */}
{/* Also, probably a good place to communicate that objects can represent anything, from 3D objects to HTML elements. */}
{/* We can probably drive the point further by saying that you could even have dummy objects that don't represent anything on the scene. */}
