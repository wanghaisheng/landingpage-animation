## Introduction

In this manual, we'll learn how to add music tracks that are synchronized to our animation.
We'll add a music track to a [Sequence](/docs/latest/manual/sequences).
If you're new to sequences, check out [Working with Sequences](/docs/latest/manual/sequences) or the [`Sequence` API Reference](/docs/latest/api/core#sequence).

## Adding audio tracks to Sequences

We can attach audio tracks to Sequences using [sequence.attachAudio](/docs/latest/api/core#sequence.attachaudio).
Theatre.js will then play the audio track every time the Sequence is played with the timings in sync.

```ts
console.log('Loading audio...')
sheet.sequence.attachAudio({ source: 'http://localhost:3000/audio.mp3' }).then(() => {
  console.log('Audio loaded!')
})
```

In the above example, Theatre.js will:

1. `fetch()` the audio file
2. Create a [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) context.

   <Callout>
     If the browser is [blocking](https://developer.chrome.com/blog/autoplay/#webaudio) the audio context, Theatre.js
     will wait for a user gesture (e.g., a click/touch/key down) to initiate it. It's best to prompt the user to
     initiate audio playback. For example, we can show a {playButton} button. Once the user clicks on that button (or
     anywhere else), Theatre.js will initiate the audio context.
   </Callout>

3. [Decode](https://docs.theatrejs.com/in-depth/#sound-and-music:~:text=Decode,the%20audio.) the audio.
4. Resolve the returned Promise. After this, when you call [Sequence.play](/docs/latest/api/core#sequence.play), the audio track will play simultaneously and in sync.

## Create a custom audio graph

If you would like to have more control over audio loading or audio setup, you can provide your own audio graph, like so:

```ts
// create an AudioContext using the Audio API
const audioContext = new AudioContext()
// create an AudioBuffer from your audio file or generate one on the fly
const audioBuffer: AudioBuffer = someAudioBuffer
// the audio output.
const destinationNode = audioContext.destination

sheet.sequence
  .attachAudio({
    source: audioBuffer,
    audioContext,
    destinationNode,
  })
  // this promise resolves immediately as everything is already provided
  .then(() => {
    sequence.play()
  })
```

Or you re-use the Sequence's built-in audio graph, which is exposed through the result of the `attachAudio(/*...*/)` promise:

```ts
sheet.sequence
  .attachAudio({
    source: '/music.mp3',
  })
  .then((audioGraph) => {
    // this is the audioContext that the sequence created.
    const audioContext = audioGraph.audioContext
    // this is the main gainNode that the sequence will feed its audio into
    const sequenceGain = audioGraph.gainNode
    // disconnect it from audioGraph.destinationNode so we can feed it into our
    // own audioGraph.
    // at this point, audio would be inaudible
    sequenceGain.disconnect()
    // create our own GainNode
    const loweredGain = audioContext.createGain()
    // lower gain (volume) to 10%
    loweredGain.gain.setValueAtTime(0.1, audioContext.currentTime)
    // connect the sequence's gain to our lowered gain
    sequenceGain.connect(loweredGain)
    // and connect the lower gain to the audioContext's destination
    loweredGain.connect(audioContext.destination)
    // now sequence's audio will be audible at 10% volume
  })
```
