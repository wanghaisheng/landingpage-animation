## What is a Project in Theatre.js?

All your work in Theatre.js is organized into Projects. Projects are a way to organize related work.

Theatre.js allows you to save the state of projects and consume them in `@theatre/core`.
We can create multiple Projects on a single web page, but often one project is sufficient for a whole website.

## Creating projects

You can create a project with the [getProject](/docs/latest/api/core#getproject) function in `@theatre/core`.
If a project with the given name already exists, it will return the existing project instead of creating a new one.

```typescript
import { getProject } from '@theatre/core'

// This will create a project called "My Project"
// or return it if it already exists:
const project = getProject('My Project')
```

## State

All the tweaks and animations that you create with Theatre.js are considered the project's state.
`@theatre/core` uses the project state to run your tweaks and animations, and `@theatre/studio` is an editor for the project state.

This state is stored as a JSON object in `localStorage` when the studio is open and can be exported as a JSON file.

To export the project, click on the name of the project in the [Outline Panel](/docs/latest/manual/Studio#outline-panel) of the studio and then click on the "Export [Project's name]" button in the top right corner of the screen as seen below.

You can load a project's state from a JSON file by passing the state down as an object in the configuration of [getProject](/docs/latest/api/core#getproject):

```typescript
import { getProject } from '@theatre/core'
import projectState from './state.json'

// This will load the state from the `state.json` file
const project = getProject('My Project', { state: projectState })
```

Currently, the configuration object of [getProject](/docs/latest/api/core#getproject) consists only of the `state` property.

When using Studio, loading a project happens asynchronously. You can wait for the project to load through [Project.ready](/docs/latest/api/core#project.ready) and [Project.isReady](/docs/latest/api/core#project.isready)

```ts
project.ready.then(() => console.log('Project loaded!'))
```
