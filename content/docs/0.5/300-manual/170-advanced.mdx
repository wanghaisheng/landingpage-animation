## rafDrivers <Since version="0.6.0" />

`rafDriver`s allow you to control when and how often computations in Theatre tick forward. (raf stands for [`requestAnimationFrame`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/window/requestAnimationFrame)).

The default `rafDriver` in Theatre creates a `raf` loop and ticks forward on each frame. You can create your own `rafDriver`, which enables the following use-cases:

1. When using Theatre.js alongside other animation libs (`@react-three/fiber`/`gsap`/`lenis`/`etc`), you'd want all animation libs to use a single `raf` loop to keep the libraries in sync and also to get better performance.
2. In XR sessions, you'd want Theatre to tick forward using [`xr.requestAnimationFrame()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/XRSession/requestAnimationFrame).
3. In some advanced cases, you'd just want to manually tick forward (many ticks per frame, or skipping many frames, etc). This is useful for recording an animation, rendering to a file, testing an animation, running benchmarks, etc.

Here is how you'd create a custom `rafDriver`:

```js
import { createRafDriver } from '@theatre/core'

const rafDriver = createRafDriver({ name: 'a custom 5fps raf driver' })

setInterval(() => {
  rafDriver.tick(performance.now())
}, 200)
```

Now, any time you set up an `onChange()` listener, pass your custom `rafDriver`:

```js
import { onChange } from '@theatre/core'

onChange(
  // let's say object is a Theatre object, the one returned from calling `sheet.object()`
  object.props,
  // this callback will now only be called at 5fps (and won't be called if there are no new values)
  // even if `sequence.play()` updates `object.props` at 60fps, this listener is called a maximum of 5fps
  (propValues) => {
    console.log(propValues)
  },
  rafDriver,
)

// this will update the values of `object.props` at 60fps, but the listener above will still get called a maximum of 5fps
sheet.sequence.play()

// we can also customize at what resolution the sequence's playhead moves forward
sheet.sequence.play({ rafDriver }) // the playhead will move forward at 5fps
```

You can optionally make studio use this `rafDriver`. This means the parts of the studio that tick based on raf, will now tick at 5fps. This is only useful if you're doing something crazy like running the studio (and not the core) in an XR frame.

```js
studio.initialize({
  __experimental_rafDriver: rafDriver,
})
```

`rafDriver`s can optionally provide a `start/stop` callback. Theatre will call `start()` when it actually has computations scheduled, and will call `stop` if there is nothing to update after a few ticks:

```js
import { createRafDriver } from '@theatre/core'
import type { IRafDriver } from '@theare/core'

function createBasicRafDriver(): IRafDriver {
  let rafId: number | null = null
  const start = (): void => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      const onAnimationFrame = (t: number) => {
        driver.tick(t)
        rafId = window.requestAnimationFrame(onAnimationFrame)
      }
      rafId = window.requestAnimationFrame(onAnimationFrame)
    } else {
      driver.tick(0)
      setTimeout(() => driver.tick(1), 0)
    }
  }

  const stop = (): void => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      if (rafId !== null) {
        window.cancelAnimationFrame(rafId)
      }
    } else {
      // nothing to do in SSR
    }
  }

  const driver = createRafDriver({ name: 'DefaultCoreRafDriver', start, stop })

  return driver
}
```

### rafDrivers in `@theatre/r3f`

You can instruct `@theatre/r3f` to use your custom `rafDriver` by wrapping your react tree in `<RafDriverProvider>`:

```jsx
import { RafDriverProvider } from '@theatre/r3f'
import { createRafDriver } from '@theatre/core'

const myCustomRafDriver = createRafDriver({ name: 'my custom raf driver', start, stop })

function App() {
  return (
    <>
      <RafDriverProvider driver={myCustomRafDriver}>
        <SomeComponent />
      </RafDriverProvider>
      {/* you can use several rafDrivers on the same page */}
      <RafDriverProvider driver={anotherRaDriver}>
        <AnotherComponent />
      </RafDriverProvider>
    </>
  )
}
```
