## Introduction

The Theatre.js Studio API enables you to define extensions that extend the Studio's UI and/or extend
the functionality of Studio.

- You can extend the UI with your own custom
  toolbar buttons, toolbar switches, and panes.
- You can extend the behavior of Studio
  by setting Selections, listening to Selection changes, and creating custom editing tools for Theatre.js Objects.

This extension API is not stable, and it _will_ change in the future, but it is relatively easy to use.
To help you learn the API, this article walks through building an example extension that shows off some core features of the API.
But, before we start building, let's take a look at the Studio, so we know what and where buttons, switches, and panes are.

### Anatomy of the UI

Here's an image of the Studio with two extensions on a webpage with a gray background. Below
the image is a table naming and describing the parts of the UI.

</table>

## Extending the Studio

Now that we've taken a look at the different parts of the Studio's UI, let's extend it with our own functionality.

### Hello World

Below is the starter code for an extension that, so far, just has a single toolbar button. After adding this code to your project,
you will see an additional "üëÅ" button appear in the top left of Studio; hovering over the button will display
the tooltip "Example Button".

```ts
// The code below assumes that your project is set up with TypeScript and a bundler.
import studio from '@theatre/studio'

const extensionConfig: IExtension = {
  id: 'hello-world-extension',
  toolbars: {
    global(set, studio) {
      set([
        {
          type: 'Icon',
          title: 'Example Button',
          svgSource: 'üëÅ',
        },
      ])
    },
  },
  panes: [],
}
studio.extend(extensionConfig)
studio.initialize()
```

Extensions are defined using a JavaScript object that your code passes as an argument to `studio.extend(extensionConfig)`
_before_ your code calls `studio.initialize()`.
Your extension object requires a unique `id`, a `toolbars` object &ndash; an object containing functions that set toolbar data so
that Studio can display your extension toolbar buttons and switches &ndash;
and a `panes` array &ndash; a list of objects that define your extension's pane metadata and callbacks. We'll
talk about panes [below](#panes), but for now, let's take a closer look at creating buttons and switches.

### Toolbar buttons and switches

In this section, you'll learn how to add custom buttons and switches to the [global toolbar](#anatomy-global-toolbar) as a part of your extension. _Note that it is also
possible to define [custom buttons and switches in panes](#buttons-and-switches-in-panes)._

In order to define global buttons and switches, you must implement a `toolbars.global(set, studio)` function in your extension config object.

This function is called by Studio upon initialization of your extension, with the arguments `set` and `studio`.

- `set(toolset)` &ndash; a callback that takes an argument of an array of button and switch metadata objects (this array is a `ToolsetConfig`).
- `studio` &ndash; the entire studio API.

In order to define buttons and switches, you call the `set()` callback in your extension's
`toolbars.global(set, studio)` function with a `ToolsetConfig` array. Let's take a look at how to do that now.

#### Buttons

Below is a modified TypeScript snippet from the starter code above that defines a button with an `onClick` callback that you can customize to do whatever you want.

```ts
global(set, studio) {
    const toolsetConfig: ToolsetConfig = [{
        type: 'Icon',
        title: 'Example Button',
        svgSource: 'üëÅ',
        onClick: () => console.log('button clicked!')
    }]
    set(toolsetConfig)
},
```

#### Switches

Below is a modified `toolbars.global(set, studio)` function that defines a switch with two options: 'yes' and 'no'.
A switch can have multiple options, but only one may be selected at a time, as determined by the switch's `value`.
When defining a switch, note that you have to manage setting and changing the switch's value yourself.
To do this, you define an `onChange(value)` function which calls `toolbars.global`'s `set` callback with a brand new `ToolsetConfig` array containing the switch metadata, but with a new value.
Let's take a look at some code that does just that:

```ts
import type {ToolsetConfig} from '@theatre/studio'

/* ... */

const getToolsetConfig = (
  switchValue: string,
  switchOnChange: (value: string) => void,
): ToolsetConfig => [
  {
    type: 'Switch',
    value: switchValue,
    onChange: switchOnChange,
    options: [
      {
        value: 'no',
        label: 'say no',
        svgSource: 'üëé',
      },
      {
        value: 'yes',
        label: 'say yes',
        svgSource: 'üëç',
      },
    ],
  },
]

/* ... */

global(set, studio) {
  const setSwitchConfig =
    (value: string) => set(getToolsetConfig(value, setSwitchConfig))
  setSwitchConfig('no')
  return () => console.log('toolbar removed!')
}
```

### Panes

#### Defining a pane

Panes are like windows that can be opened, closed, resized, and moved around the screen.
Simply add an object to your extension config's `panes: [{ class, mount }]` array where:

- `class: "my-pane-name"` is a unique name for your pane, and
- `mount(paneInstance) { ... }` is a function that is called when your pane is opened

The `mount(paneInstance) { ... }` function receives an argument object with two properties, `paneInstance.paneId` and `paneInstance.node`.

- `paneId` is a unique ID string assigned to the pane when it is opened.
- `node` is an HTML element that you will programmatically put your pane's contents into.

We can return a `() => void` function from our `mount(pane)` function to be called when the pane is closed, which you can use for cleanup.

```ts
panes: [
  {
    class: 'example',
    mount({paneId, node}) {
      node.innerText = 'Hello World'
      return () => console.log('pane closed!')
    },
  },
],
```

#### Opening a pane

To open a pane you defined in your extension, simply call `studio.createPane(id)`.

```ts
studio.createPane('example')
```

#### Buttons and switches in a pane

If you want to define buttons and switches that show up in a pane instead of in the global toolbar,
you can add a function to your extension's `toolbars` object with a key other than `global`.
Let's take a look at how you would set up a toolbar named `exampleToolbar` that shows up in a pane,
but not in the global toolbar:

```ts
const extensionConfig: IExtension = {
  id: 'hello-world-extension',
  toolbars: {
    exampleToolbar(set, studio) {
      const toolsetConfig: ToolsetConfig = [
        {
          type: 'Icon',
          title: 'Example Button',
          svgSource: 'üçï',
          onClick: () => {},
        },
      ]
      set(toolsetConfig)
      return () => console.log('toolbar removed!')
    },
  },
  panes: [
    {
      class: 'example',
      mount({ paneId, node }) {
        studio.ui.renderToolset('exampleToolbar', node)
        return () => console.log('pane closed!')
      },
    },
  ],
}
```

The two key things to note in this example are:

- `toolbars.exampleToolbar` is defined in the same way as `toolbars.global`, and
- we use `studio.ui.renderToolset('exampleToolbar', node)` to insert the `exampleToolbar` into our pane's HTML when the pane mounts (when it opens).

## Extending Studio behavior

So far we took a look at how you can extend the Studio, in this section we'll see how to extend its behavior.

### Setting selections and listening to selection changes

Theatre.js allows one or more Sheets or Sheet Objects to be selected.
Selections are represented as a list of the selected Sheets and/or Sheet Objects.

We can listen to selection changes with `studio.onSelectionChange(callback)`.

```ts
studio.onSelectionChange((newSelecton) => {
  // do something
})
```

Here, `newSelecton` is a list of Theatre.js Objects and/or Sheets.

We can then set the selection with `studio.setSelection(array)`, passing in the Sheets/Sheet Objects to be selected.

```ts
const obj = sheet.object('Some Object')

studio.setSelection([obj])
```

### Modifying Theatre.js objects programmatically

There are two ways to set the values of props using the Studio API: transactions and scrubs.

Both transactions and scrubs create entries in the Studio history stack, so the author can undo and redo them using ctrl+z.

#### Using `studio.transaction(fn)`

Change prop values within a callback function, `fn`.

All changes made within the `fn` are grouped into a single undoable action.
Changes made inside a transaction are either all committed, or all discarded.

```ts
// Commit a transaction to the Theatre.js Project state
studio.transaction(({set}) => {
  set(obj.props, {
    ...initial,
    x: x + initial.x,
    y: y + initial.y,
  })
}))
```

#### Using `studio.scrub()` for moving values

While transactions require us to do all our changes at once, scrubs allow us to add changes to a transaction over time, which we can later either commit or discard.
Changes are immediately reflected in the state, however an undo-step is only made on commit.

Scrubs are useful for example to implement drags, where we don't want to individually commit every in-between value to the history stack, only the end-state.

```ts
const scrub = studio.scrub()
scrub.capture(({ set }) => {
  // no history changes are actually made until scrub.commit()
  set(obj.props, {
    ...initial,
    x: x + initial.x,
    y: y + initial.y,
  })
})

// We can either commit the scrub, creating an undo-step...
scrub.commit()

// ...or discard the scrub, reverting the changes made within
scrub.discard()
```

## Managing extension state using Theatre.js Objects

Putting all these concepts together, we can create sheet objects via our extension.
This has the benefit of persisting our extension's data across reloads and project states.

```ts
import {types, val, onChange} from '@theatre/core'
import type {ISheetObject} from '@theatre/core'
import type {ToolsetConfig} from '@theatre/studio'

  global(set, studio) {
    // A sheet object used by this extension
    const obj = studio
      .getStudioProject()
      .sheet('example extension UI')
      .object('editor', {
          exampleProp: types.stringLiteral('yes', {
              no: 'no',
              yes: 'yes',
          }),
      })

    const updateToolset = () =>
      set([
        {
          type: 'Switch',
          value: val(obj.props.exampleProp),
          onChange: (value) =>
            studio.transaction(({set}) => set(obj.props.exampleProp, value)),
          options: [
            {
              value: 'no',
              label: 'say no',
              svgSource: 'üëé',
            },
            {
              value: 'yes',
              label: 'say yes',
              svgSource: 'üëç',
            },
          ],
        },
      ])

    const untapFn = onChange(obj.props.exampleProp, () => {
      updateToolset()
    })

    // initial update
    updateToolset()

    return untapFn
  },
```

This approach has the added benefit that the state of your extension is managed by the Studio, and
can even be modified and animated using the Studio.

## Putting it all together: a direct-manipulation extension

Finally, we can take everything we've learned about extending Studio with buttons, switches, panes and custom tools into one extension!
Below is a CodeSandbox with running TypeScript code.

<Callout type="info">
  Try clicking and dragging the ü•ö, üê£, or üê•. Once you've finished dragging, try pressing `ctrl`+`z` to undo the drag.
  Also try using the Studio Outline tree to select objects and notice how it affects the styling of the ü•ö, üê£, and üê•
  and vice versa. You can even drag around the objects while creating keyframes for animations.
</Callout>

## Extensions are hot-reloadable <Since version="0.7.0" />

Studio extensions are hot-reloadable, meaning that you can make changes to your extension code and see the changes reflected in the Studio without having to reload the page.
Simply run `studio.extend(extension, {__experimental_reconfigure: true})` to replace your extension with its new version.
